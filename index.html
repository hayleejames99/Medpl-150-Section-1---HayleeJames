     As a media student, my goal is to bring my artistic concepts to life through experimentation with various forms of media. My passion for literature is the main motivation for my work. I often draw inspiration from the media I regularly consume like films, podcasts, and songs, to spoken word, vlogs, books, and affirmation quotes. I am drawn to the world of photography, photoshop, and collage. Iâ€™m excited to explore how these mediums can be combined with video and narrative elements to create layered, multifaceted compositions. I aim to tell stories that reflect themes that resonate deeply with me, and content that is both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally engaging. Ultimately, I strive to connect with viewers on a personal level through my work
