    <h1>Homework 2 Image 2</h1>

    <p>This is the St. Vincent Ferrer Roman Cathlotic Church. After taking an Art History class in high school, I developed an apperciation for church architechture. I love the elaborate structure of the round window at its entrance. The ribbed vaults, pointed arches, and symmetry, it encapulates the theme of Romanesque churches. I decided to lower the exposure to -0.12. I lowered saturation to -35, and vibrance to -48</p>
