<p>Recently, I’ve been feeling like I’m being called to nature. I want to explore places I’ve never been and connect more with my environment outside of the city. Urban life can feel suffocating, it’s a hectic yet mundane cycle. Leaving me with little time and energy to fully relax and recharge. I’d rather be like this cat, taking it slow and existing in the stillness. I find it healing to truly be mindful of the world around us. This photo is a representation of what I need right now. I decided to used a Triad colour theme that illustrated a sense of calmness reflected by my use of muted and desaturated colours. I went for a soft green for the stones. This earthy tone can be associated with elements present in nature like moss or sage. Since I could only use three colours, I intentionally used a combination of both the stones and the greenery peaking through the cracks. The light blue for the water to brighten the scene and further promote the feeling of peace and tranquility. Lastly, I chose a terracotta colour for the cat and used the came green for the pigmentation of its fur. The colour of the cat’s body reminds me of tree bark. I intend on using colours that naturally occur in nature.</p>
