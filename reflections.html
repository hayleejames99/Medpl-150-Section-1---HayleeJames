<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>I use photography to hold on to memories. It’s more than just a picture to me, It’s a way of preserving the feelings and moments that I never want to lose. A photograph feels like a reminder that time and whenever I look back, it’s almost like I’m reliving that moment again. I love capturing the things I find beautiful, whether that’s my family and friends or small details in nature that catch my eye. Photography allows me to hold onto these memories in a way that feels tangible and meaningful. I’ve had an interest in photography since elementary school. Even when I was younger, I would take pictures of anything that I thought would make a good scene. Sometimes it would be the sunlight peaking through towering trees in Prospect Park, creating shadows of the leaves on the ground. Or the way the sheer curtains draped over my window. Photography gives me a way to express myself without words. To communicate my interests, opinions, and things that hold value to me. I began to experiment with editing apps like VSCO, Lightroom, and Picsart to personalize them and make each image my own. Editing gave me the ability to highlight the colors, features, person, or thing I wanted to emphasize in a photo. For example, I leaned toward warmer tones to convey comfort and connection, which I resonate with the most. While other times I used cooler filters to make the image moody or emulate the feeling of isolation. This process of editing allowed me to not only capture meaningful things, but to personalize how I get to remember certain aspects of the image. I view photography as a reminder that even though the world is hectic right now, there is still beauty in everyday things. Prompting us to slow down and notice what might otherwise be overlooked in times like these. It can be as simple as an image of your friends talking in the school cafe, the cat at your local bodega, the hibiscus flowers that grow in your porch, or the dining table at a family gathering. The news has been overwhelmingly negative lately. Consuming media about current events can increase anxiety and fear for our futures. Small gimples of the beauty and abundance around us is a reminder that we are not always in a state of chaos. That we are allowed to take a step back and try to enjoy the present. I believe that photography can promote the importance of community. Our world at this moment can feel divided but with photos that showcase your personal communities we can shift the focus to connection. Taking photos of family, friends, neighborhoods, and gatherings highlights how essential community is in our lives. Having a support system is one of the most valuable things we can have right now. It allows us to find the people we connect with the most, to share experiences, and to pass on knowledge about what is happening in the world around us.Photography and image making has the ability to illustrate the balance between the challenges we face and what we should express gratitude for. Combining images and text can work to tell deeper stories and convey a more direct message. Photos inherently have the ability to evoke emotion or a reaction. When paired with words, it opens up the conversation to more nuanced takes. Someone can have an entirely different view than someone else when viewing it. The way someone interprets media is reliant upon their beliefs, personality, emotions, and experiences. Photos can encourage people to pause and reflect. That is also necessary in the world we’re in at the moment. Ultimately, I think photography and image-making is the perfect outlet of expression to document how we will remember the past. Photography can give us comfort, educate, inspire, and connect us. By using it intentionally, I hope to give viewers a reminder that there is always something to be grateful for. Even in times of crisis and chaos, it's acceptable to appreciate the stillness of a beautiful photo.
