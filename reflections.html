<p><u>PHOTOGRAPHY:</u></p>
<p>I use photography to hold on to memories. It’s more than just a picture to me, It’s a way of preserving the feelings and moments that I never want to lose. A photograph feels like a reminder that time and whenever I look back, it’s almost like I’m reliving that moment again. I love capturing the things I find beautiful, whether that’s my family and friends or small details in nature that catch my eye. Photography allows me to hold onto these memories in a way that feels tangible and meaningful. I’ve had an interest in photography since elementary school. Even when I was younger, I would take pictures of anything that I thought would make a good scene. Sometimes it would be the sunlight peaking through towering trees in Prospect Park, creating shadows of the leaves on the ground. Or the way the sheer curtains draped over my window. Photography gives me a way to express myself without words. To communicate my interests, opinions, and things that hold value to me. I began to experiment with editing apps like VSCO, Lightroom, and Picsart to personalize them and make each image my own. Editing gave me the ability to highlight the colors, features, person, or thing I wanted to emphasize in a photo. For example, I leaned toward warmer tones to convey comfort and connection, which I resonate with the most. While other times I used cooler filters to make the image moody or emulate the feeling of isolation. This process of editing allowed me to not only capture meaningful things, but to personalize how I get to remember certain aspects of the image. I view photography as a reminder that even though the world is hectic right now, there is still beauty in everyday things. Prompting us to slow down and notice what might otherwise be overlooked in times like these. It can be as simple as an image of your friends talking in the school cafe, the cat at your local bodega, the hibiscus flowers that grow in your porch, or the dining table at a family gathering. The news has been overwhelmingly negative lately. Consuming media about current events can increase anxiety and fear for our futures. Small gimples of the beauty and abundance around us is a reminder that we are not always in a state of chaos. That we are allowed to take a step back and try to enjoy the present. I believe that photography can promote the importance of community. Our world at this moment can feel divided but with photos that showcase your personal communities we can shift the focus to connection. Taking photos of family, friends, neighborhoods, and gatherings highlights how essential community is in our lives. Having a support system is one of the most valuable things we can have right now. It allows us to find the people we connect with the most, to share experiences, and to pass on knowledge about what is happening in the world around us.Photography and image making has the ability to illustrate the balance between the challenges we face and what we should express gratitude for. Combining images and text can work to tell deeper stories and convey a more direct message. Photos inherently have the ability to evoke emotion or a reaction. When paired with words, it opens up the conversation to more nuanced takes. Someone can have an entirely different view than someone else when viewing it. The way someone interprets media is reliant upon their beliefs, personality, emotions, and experiences. Photos can encourage people to pause and reflect. That is also necessary in the world we’re in at the moment. Ultimately, I think photography and image-making is the perfect outlet of expression to document how we will remember the past. Photography can give us comfort, educate, inspire, and connect us. By using it intentionally, I hope to give viewers a reminder that there is always something to be grateful for. Even in times of crisis and chaos, it's acceptable to appreciate the stillness of a beautiful photo.</p> 

<p><u>AI:</u></p>
<p> Today, it’s almost impossible to navigate the internet without interacting with some form of AI. From quick AI results from a Google search, to translating languages, to social media filters, and algorithms. Posts on your explore page leave you wondering if that breathtaking nature view was taken by someone on a hike or if it was artificially generated. It’s apparent that AI has garnered the attention of  big companies and organizations. They take full advantage of these platforms to further expand their online political influence. The idea of AI being used to create “right-wing political fantasies” feels almost dystopian. There are no limitations to what you can create, giving users endless outcomes with no restrictions due to minimal human input. Fabricated scenes of Trump defeating liberal forces and his vision for what he refers to as the “Riviera of the Middle East” are off-putting. The video of “Trump Gaza” was especially baffling to see. Trump is illustrated to be a figure who is worshiped. In this fantasy, Trump is hailed as an icon with gold statues being a recurring ornament in this dictatorial version of society. Though this video was posted by an account unaffiliated with the White House, Trump sharing this video on his page showcases his support for disturbing content like this. Our own president doesn’t sense the urgency in the rising ubiquity of AI. The prevalence of this tool introduces  a set of multifactorial challenges. Ranging from ethical, societal, legal, economic, to technical issues that are now a cause for concern. AI has even infiltrated the minds of our elders. My mom often sees videos and images that she would perceive as real people or situations. Upon closer inspection, you’d come to find out that it was fully curated by AI. Paradoxically, younger generations who are widely considered to be tech savvy, even have trouble discerning what’s real online. As  AI technology continues to advance, it has proven to be difficult for us to make such a judgment. This sparks the conversation of how we can continue to trust what we see and hear online. The problem isn’t AI itself; I believe the issue lies in how we choose to utilize this tool. When it is used with the intent of deceiving and as a tactic for spreading hateful content, the resource can be demonized. AI content is lazy and uninspiring; there are copious ways to communicate ideas to the public without depending on a computer to generate absurd and cartoonish media. I found it unnecessary that there was a Studio Ghibli-style animation of a Dominican immigrant being arrested by ICE. It doesn’t read as mature or professional for a government social media page to share. AI doesn’t come equipped with a moral compass, which leads to users feeding it certain data or objectives and the platform producing unethical results. Such as sensitive, graphic, and controversial content that violates physical and moral laws. I believe that using these platforms in light of distressing situations is unacceptable.</p>
<p><u>Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis:</u></p>
<p>Narrative text and dialogue, detailed illustrations, video, and candid photography are used to tell Memunatu’s story: The distant patient. Illustrations were used to enhance the storytelling. Bringing the narrative to life by providing visuals to further immerse the viewer. Allowing us to understand how the events unfolded without having to imagine them ourselves. As Memuatu recounts her experience, the colorful and detailed illustrations accompany her story. Giving us a look into the daily life of a woman in a West African village. Depicting the struggle they endure due to the limited accessibility to hospitals, many women like her end up in life threatening positions under the care of untrained traditional birth attendants. The photographs used are candid, showcasing the reality of  her experiences. The pictures reveal women resting their weak bodies, the infirmary room, Memunatu with her baby, and her interaction with a doctor. The video gives us further context to the severity of Memunatu’s condition and the possible negative outcomes of not getting the proper treatment. I felt more connected to the story when seeing photos of real people. Though, the illustrations painted the picture of certain events with greater detail. The drawings described parts of the story that could not be photographed or recorded. If the story was told only with text, it may not have been as engaging for the reader. Visuals pull the viewer into the world of the story, while the text can only tell you the facts. If only photographs were used, they wouldn’t capture the entire story. Pictures of Memunatu at the hospital and afterwards wouldn't highlight her struggle in her village. Placing less emphasis the emotional distress she went through during and after her pregnacy.</p>
